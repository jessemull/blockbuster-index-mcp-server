# Blockbuster Index MCP Server

The **Blockbuster Index MCP Server** calculates the **Blockbuster Index** for all U.S. states by aggregating multiple retail and digital commerce signals. Each signal runs as an independent ECS Fargate task on a daily schedule, fetching data from various retail APIs, computing weighted scores, and uploading the results to S3 for use by the **Blockbuster Index** website.

The **Blockbuster Index** is an AI-powered exploration of how consumer buying habits have shifted across the United States from traditional brick-and-mortar retail to online commerce. Inspired by the cultural decline of physical video rental stores like Blockbuster, this project builds a unique state-by-state index using signals that reflect the tension between digital and analog purchasing behavior.

This MCP server is part of the **Blockbuster Index Project** which includes the following repositories:

## Project Overview

This project calculates the **Blockbuster Index** by aggregating distinct retail footprint signals for each U.S. state. The server fetches data from various retail APIs, applies weighted calculations, and uploads the results to S3 for use by the **Blockbuster Index** website.

The calculation process currently includes the following signals with more signals on the way:

- **Amazon** – E-commerce adoption and digital retail presence through job posting analysis with sliding window aggregation for improved accuracy.
- **Census** – Retail market maturity using U.S. Census Bureau data: retail establishments per 100,000 people.
- **Broadband** – Internet infrastructure and connectivity metrics.
- **Walmart** – Physical retail presence and technology job distribution through dual-signal analysis of Walmart job postings.

Each signal is weighted and combined to generate a comprehensive score that reflects the balance between digital and physical retail activity in each state.

**Signal Inversion:**
Some signals are inverted after normalization so that higher scores always indicate greater digital adoption.

## Architecture Overview

The Blockbuster Index MCP Server employs a **modular microservices architecture** where each signal runs as an independent ECS Fargate task. This design provides several key advantages:

### Modular Signal Processing

- **Independent Deployment**: Each signal can be deployed, updated, and scaled independently.
- **Fault Isolation**: A failure in one signal doesn't affect the others.
- **Resource Optimization**: Each task can be configured with appropriate CPU/memory for its specific workload.
- **Parallel Execution**: Signals can run concurrently, reducing total processing time.

### Task Architecture

- **Amazon Signal Task**: Web scraping and job posting analysis with sliding window aggregation.
- **Census Signal Task**: Demographic data processing and analysis.
- **Broadband Signal Task**: Infrastructure and connectivity metrics.
- **Walmart Signal Task**: Web scraping and job posting analysis with sliding window aggregation.
- **Blockbuster Index Task**: Signal aggregation and final index calculation.

### Data Flow

1. **Signal Collection**: Each signal task fetches and processes its respective data.
2. **Data Persistence**: Signal-specific data is stored in DynamoDB tables.
3. **S3 Storage**: Individual signal results are uploaded to S3 with versioned filenames for use by the **Blockbuster Index** website.
4. **Index Calculation**: The blockbuster index task downloads all signal results and computes the final index.
5. **Result Publication**: Final index is uploaded to S3 for consumption by the website and stored in DynamoDB tables.

## Signal Calculations

See [SIGNALS.md](SIGNALS.md) for detailed information about how each signal is calculated and how they are combined to create the Blockbuster Index.

## ECS Task Scheduling

The system employs a sophisticated scheduling architecture using AWS EventBridge to orchestrate the execution of all signals and the final index calculation.

### Execution Schedule

- **Signal Tasks**: Run daily at staggered intervals to avoid resource contention.
- **Blockbuster Index Task**: Runs daily after all signals complete.

### Task Dependencies

The scheduling system ensures proper execution order:

1. All signal tasks run independently and in parallel.
2. Each signal uploads its results to DynamoDB tables and S3 upon completion.
3. The blockbuster index task waits for all signal results before executing.
4. Final index is published to S3 for website consumption and DynamoDB tables for historical trends.

### Error Handling

- **Retry Logic**: Failed tasks are automatically retried with exponential backoff.
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch alarms trigger on task failures.
- **Rollback Capability**: Previous versions can be quickly restored.

## Environments

The **Blockbuster Index** operates in multiple environments to ensure smooth development, testing, and production workflows. Configuration files and environment variables should be set to point to the correct environment (dev/prod), depending on the stage of the application. Separate cloudfront distributions exist for each environment.
