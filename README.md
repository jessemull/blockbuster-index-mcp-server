# Blockbuster Index MCP Server

The **Blockbuster Index MCP Server** calculates the **Blockbuster Index** for all U.S. states by aggregating multiple retail footprint signals. It runs as an ECS Fargate task on a daily schedule, fetching data from various retail APIs, computing weighted scores, and uploading the results to S3 for use by the **Blockbuster Index** website.

The **Blockbuster Index** is an AI-powered exploration of how consumer buying habits have shifted across the United Statesâ€”from traditional brick-and-mortar retail to online commerce. Inspired by the cultural decline of physical video rental stores like Blockbuster, this project builds a unique state-by-state index using signals that reflect the tension between digital and analog purchasing behavior.

This repository is part of the **Blockbuster Index Project** which includes the following repositories:

- **[Blockbuster Index MCP Server](https://github.com/jessemull/blockbuster-index-mcp-server)**: The **Blockbuster Index** calculation server (this repository).

## Project Overview

This project calculates the **Blockbuster Index** by aggregating seven different retail footprint signals for each US state. The server fetches data from various retail APIs, applies weighted calculations, and uploads the results to S3 for consumption by the Blockbuster Index website.

The calculation process includes:

- **Amazon**: E-commerce adoption and digital retail presence
- **Analog**: Traditional retail and physical store metrics
- **Broadband**: Internet infrastructure and connectivity
- **E-commerce**: Online shopping adoption rates
- **Physical**: Brick-and-mortar retail presence
- **Streaming**: Digital media consumption patterns
- **Walmart**: Traditional retail giant footprint

Each signal is weighted and combined to create a comprehensive score reflecting the balance between digital and physical retail in each state.

## Environments

The **Blockbuster Index MCP Server** operates in multiple environments to ensure smooth development, testing, and production workflows.

### Development Environment

The development environment runs locally and writes results to local files for testing and development purposes.

- Local file output: `dev/scores/blockbuster-index.json`
- Environment: `NODE_ENV=development`

### Production Environment

The production environment runs as an ECS Fargate task and uploads results to S3 for the website.

- S3 output: `s3://blockbuster-index-client-prod/data/data.json`
- Environment: `NODE_ENV=production`
- Schedule: Daily execution via EventBridge

## Tech Stack

The **Blockbuster Index MCP Server** is built using modern technologies to ensure reliability, scalability, and maintainability.

- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and enhanced developer experience for the server codebase.

- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing the server application.

- **AWS ECS Fargate**: Containerized deployment platform that runs the server as a scheduled task without managing servers.

- **AWS CloudFormation**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is used to define and provision AWS resources like ECS tasks, EventBridge rules, and IAM roles.

- **AWS EventBridge**: Triggers scheduled executions of the server to refresh data periodically (daily by default).

- **AWS S3**: Stores the calculated index data for consumption by the website, ensuring high availability and durability.

- **AWS CloudWatch**: Provides logging and monitoring capabilities for the server, including structured logging with bunyan.

- **Docker**: Containerization technology used to package the application for consistent deployment across environments.

- **Webpack**: Bundles the TypeScript code for production deployment with optimization and minification.

- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework used for unit and integration testing, ensuring code reliability and preventing regressions.

- **ESLint & Prettier**: Linting and formatting tools that enforce code consistency, reduce syntax errors, and improve maintainability.

- **Commitizen**: A tool for enforcing a standardized commit message format, improving version control history and making collaboration more structured.

- **Husky & lint-staged**: Git hooks that ensure code quality by running linting and formatting before commits.

- **Bunyan**: Structured logging library that provides JSON-formatted logs for better parsing and analysis.

- **AWS SDK v3**: Modern AWS SDK for JavaScript that provides type-safe access to AWS services like S3.

This tech stack ensures that the **Blockbuster Index MCP Server** remains performant, secure, and easily maintainable while leveraging AWS infrastructure for scalability and reliability.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jessemull/blockbuster-index-mcp-server.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd blockbuster-index-mcp-server
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section).

## Signal Calculation

The **Blockbuster Index** is calculated by aggregating seven different retail footprint signals, each with specific weights:

| Signal         | Weight | Description                                     |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Amazon**     | 10%    | E-commerce adoption and digital retail presence |
| **Analog**     | 10%    | Traditional retail and physical store metrics   |
| **Broadband**  | 20%    | Internet infrastructure and connectivity        |
| **E-commerce** | 20%    | Online shopping adoption rates                  |
| **Physical**   | 15%    | Brick-and-mortar retail presence                |
| **Streaming**  | 15%    | Digital media consumption patterns              |
| **Walmart**    | 10%    | Traditional retail giant footprint              |

Each signal fetches data from external APIs and returns scores for all 50 US states. The final index score is calculated as a weighted sum of all signals.

### Running Individual Signals

To test individual signals during development:

```bash
# Run a specific signal
npm run signal

# Run all signals
npm run signal:all
```

## Commits & Commitizen

This project uses **Commitizen** to ensure commit messages follow a structured format and versioning is consistent. Commit linting is enforced via a pre-commit husky hook.

### Making a Commit

To make a commit in the correct format, run the following command. Commitzen will walk the user through the creation of a structured commit message and versioning:

```bash
npm run commit
```

## Linting & Formatting

This project uses **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code quality enforcement. Linting is enforced during every CI/CD pipeline to ensure consistent standards.

### Linting Commands

Run linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Fix linting issues automatically:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### Formatting Commands

Format using prettier:

```bash
npm run format
```

Check formatting:

```bash
npm run format:check
```

### Pre-Commit Hook

**Lint-staged** is configured to run linting before each commit. The commit will be blocked if linting fails, ensuring code quality at the commit level.

## Unit Tests & Code Coverage

### Unit Tests

This project uses **Jest** for testing. Code coverage is enforced during every CI/CD pipeline. The build will fail if any tests fail or coverage drops below **100%**.

Run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Run tests in watch mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Open coverage report:

```bash
npm run coverage:open
```

### Code Coverage

Coverage thresholds are enforced at **100%** for all metrics. The build will fail if coverage drops below this threshold.

## Error & Performance Monitoring

This project uses **AWS CloudWatch** for server-side error and performance monitoring with structured logging.

### Configuration

CloudWatch logging is configured with environment-specific settings. Logs are sent to CloudWatch Logs with structured JSON formatting for better parsing and analysis.

### CloudWatch Logging

The server uses **Bunyan** for structured logging with the following features:

- **JSON-formatted logs** for better parsing and analysis
- **Performance metrics** for tracking calculation times
- **Signal-specific logging** for monitoring individual signal performance
- **Error context** for debugging and monitoring
- **CloudWatch integration** for centralized log management
