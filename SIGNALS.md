# Signal Calculations

This document describes how each signal is calculated and how they are combined to create the Blockbuster Index.

## Amazon Signal

**Purpose:**
Measures e-commerce adoption and digital retail presence by analyzing Amazon job posting patterns across all U.S. states.

**Data Source:**

- Amazon job postings via web scraping.

**Calculation Method:**

- Scrapes job postings for each state using Puppeteer.
- Counts total job postings per state for the current day.
- Maintains a 90-day sliding window of job posting data in DynamoDB.
- Calculates rolling averages to smooth out daily fluctuations and seasonal variations.
- Normalizes job counts by workforce size per state using Census Bureau labor force data.

**Normalization & Inversion:**

- Scores are normalized to a 0–100 scale (higher = more digital adoption).
- No inversion is applied to this signal.

**Technical Implementation:**

- Puppeteer for dynamic content scraping.
- Retry logic with exponential backoff.
- Handles rate limiting and anti-bot measures.
- Processes results in parallel for efficiency.
- DynamoDB integration for sliding window data persistence and automatic window management.

## Census Signal

**Purpose:**
Provides a measure of physical retail market maturity using U.S. Census Bureau data on retail establishments.

**Data Source:**

- U.S. Census Bureau API (retail establishment counts, population, workforce size).

**Calculation Method:**

- Calculates retail establishments per 100,000 population (establishment count / population × 100,000).

**Normalization & Inversion:**

- Scores are normalized to a 0–100 scale.
- **After normalization, this score is inverted** (higher retail presence = lower digital score) to align with the Blockbuster Index's focus on digital adoption.

**Technical Implementation:**

- REST API integration with Census Bureau endpoints.
- Fetches and processes demographic data.
- Data is stored in DynamoDB for historical tracking.

## Broadband Signal

**Purpose:**
Measures the quality and reach of broadband infrastructure, a key enabler of digital commerce.

**Data Source:**

- Broadband coverage data (percent of census blocks with broadband, high-speed, gigabit, and technology diversity).

**Calculation Method:**

- Weighted sum of:
  - 30%: Basic broadband availability (percent of blocks with any broadband)
  - 40%: High-speed availability (percent of blocks with 25+ Mbps)
  - 20%: Gigabit availability (percent of blocks with gigabit)
  - 10%: Technology diversity (fraction of 5 tech types present)
- **Formula:**
  Broadband Score = 0.3 × Basic + 0.4 × High-Speed + 0.2 × Gigabit + 0.1 × Diversity

**Normalization & Inversion:**

- Scores are normalized to a 0–100 scale (higher = better broadband, more digital adoption).
- No inversion is applied to this signal.

**Technical Implementation:**

- Data aggregation and processing from S3 and/or DynamoDB.
- Weighted calculation logic as described above.

## Walmart Signal

**Purpose:**
Provides a perspective on traditional retail employment patterns by tracking Walmart jobs, offering insights into the balance between traditional and digital retail infrastructure.

**Data Source:**

- Walmart Careers job board via web scraping.

**Calculation Method:**

- Scrapes Walmart store and Sam's Club job postings across all states.
  - Reflects traditional retail presence and employment patterns.

**Normalization & Inversion:**

- Scores are normalized to a 0–100 scale.
- Inverted after normalization (higher = more digital; fewer Walmart jobs means a higher score).

**Technical Implementation:**

- Puppeteer-based web scraping with anti-detection measures.
- Job category filtering and classification.
- Sliding window aggregation for the signal.
- Workforce normalization using Census data.
- Data stored in DynamoDB for historical tracking.

**Special Notes:**

- The Walmart signal is used as a component in the Blockbuster Index with its own weight (see WEIGHTS in the codebase). There is currently no single combined "Walmart Score"; only the normalized Walmart signal is incorporated into the overall index.

## Signal Inversion Logic

Some signals represent physical presence (e.g., retail establishments, physical jobs) and must be inverted after normalization so that higher values indicate lower digital adoption.

## Blockbuster Index Calculation

The Blockbuster Index combines all individual signals using a weighted aggregation algorithm to create a comprehensive score that reflects the balance between digital and physical retail activity in each state.

### Signal Weighting System

Each signal is assigned a weight based on its relevance to the overall retail transformation:

| Signal    | Weight | Rationale                                                            |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Amazon    | 0.25   | Primary indicator of e-commerce adoption and digital retail presence |
| Walmart   | 0.25   | Dual-perspective analysis of retail employment evolution             |
| Census    | 0.25   | Demographic and economic context for retail behavior                 |
| Broadband | 0.25   | Infrastructure foundation for digital commerce                       |

### Calculation Formula

The Blockbuster Index for each state is calculated using the following formula:

```
Blockbuster Index = (Amazon Score × 0.25) + (Walmart Score × 0.25) + (Census Score × 0.25) + (Broadband Score × 0.25)
```

### Score Normalization

All individual signal scores are normalized to a 0-100 scale before aggregation:

- **0-25**: Low digital adoption, strong physical retail presence
- **26-50**: Moderate digital adoption, balanced retail landscape
- **51-75**: High digital adoption, declining physical retail
- **76-100**: Very high digital adoption, minimal physical retail presence

### Historical Tracking

The system maintains historical records of both individual signal scores and the final Blockbuster Index:

- **Daily Signal Scores**: Individual signal calculations stored in DynamoDB
- **Daily Blockbuster Index**: Final aggregated scores stored in DynamoDB
- **S3 Storage**: Versioned JSON files for web consumption
- **Metadata**: Calculation timestamps and version information

### Data Flow

1. **Signal Collection**: Each signal task runs independently and calculates state-specific scores
2. **Data Persistence**: Individual signal results stored in DynamoDB with timestamps
3. **S3 Upload**: Signal results uploaded to S3 with versioned filenames
4. **Index Calculation**: Blockbuster Index task downloads all signal results
5. **Aggregation**: Weighted combination of all signals using the formula above
6. **Result Publication**: Final Blockbuster Index uploaded to S3 for web consumption

### Quality Assurance

The calculation process includes several quality checks:

- **Data Validation**: Ensures all signal scores are within expected ranges
- **Completeness Check**: Verifies all states have data from all signals
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flags unusual score changes for investigation
- **Fallback Logic**: Uses previous day's data if current calculation fails

### Performance Optimization

The aggregation process is optimized for speed and reliability:

- **Parallel Processing**: Signal calculations run concurrently
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data cached in memory
- **Incremental Updates**: Only recalculates when new signal data is available
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when individual signals fail
